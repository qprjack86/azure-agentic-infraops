## Objective

Automate staleness detection and context auditing so optimization
gains are maintained over time.

## Tasks

| #   | Action                                                                                                           |
| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Add `lint:docs-freshness` to weekly GitHub Actions cron → opens issue when staleness detected                    |
| 2   | Create quarterly context audit cadence: checklist/script that re-runs the context optimizer skill every 3 months |
| 3   | Extend `check-docs-freshness.mjs` to cover skills and `references/` files                                        |
| 4   | Fix any remaining phantom references found by `validate-orphaned-content.mjs`                                    |

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow created with weekly cron for freshness
- [ ] `check-docs-freshness.mjs` covers skills and references
- [ ] Quarterly audit checklist documented
- [ ] No orphaned references remain
- [ ] `npm run validate:all` passes
